    title: "Automated Resume Screening",
    role: "Research Assistant",
    duration: "Jan 2021 – Jun 2021",
    description: "Contributed to an innovative project aimed at automating resume screening for candidate selection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. The project sought to improve the efficiency and accuracy of traditional, manual resume screening processes, supporting data-driven decision-making in the initial stages of recruitment by identifying eligible candidates for further evaluation.",
    responsibilities: [
      "Gathered and analyzed job requirements and criteria from organizational datasets to establish key features for automated resume screening, ensuring that the application’s assessment closely matched hiring needs.",
      "Applied NLP techniques to preprocess and structure unstructured text data from resumes, enabling the algorithm to accurately identify relevant information such as education, skills, and work experience.",
      "Developed and fine-tuned machine learning algorithms to classify and score resumes based on their match to specific job requirements, optimizing the model to achieve high accuracy in candidate selection.",
      "Created an end-to-end Python application for automated resume screening, integrating NLP and machine learning components to deliver an efficient, scalable solution for candidate evaluation.",
      "Conducted rigorous testing and validation of the application using real-world resume data, assessing model performance metrics (such as accuracy and precision) to ensure reliable, unbiased screening results.",
      "Designed data visualizations and generated analytical reports using Python, providing insights into screening accuracy, candidate fit, and the overall efficiency of the automated process."
